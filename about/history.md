OpenRPG was created on Oct 25, 2016 by [@incomingstick](https://github.com/incomingstick)

OpenRPG was invisioned by [@incomingstick](https://github.com/incomingstick) when he noticed there were no free and open source charactor creators or dungeon master tools for tabletop RPG games. He took the idea to some of his peers on the Tumblr blogging platform, and soon after began active development.

OpenRPG is still in its infancy and hopes to see its v1.0.0 release some time in 2017.

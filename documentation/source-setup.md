# Building

Currently we require `cmake` (at least v2.8.4) and `make`

## Build Script

**Linux:** run build.sh `$ ./build.sh`

## Manual build

Create a build directory `$ mkdir build && cd build`

Run cmake `$ cmake ..` **OR** Optionally run `$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/desired/install/location ..`

Run make `$ make`

# Check Integrity of build

Run make check `$ make check`

# Installing

After building run make install `$ make install`
